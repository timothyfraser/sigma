## Purpose

This book is designed to:

- **Teach reliability and Six Sigma with code-first workshops**: each chapter mixes short narrative explanations, runnable examples, and hands-on "Learning Checks."
- **Make applied methods accessible**: use plain language, small reproducible examples, and visual intuition.
- **Be classroom-friendly**: chapters are chunked for live instruction and self-paced study.

## What You'll Learn

Through a series of interactive workshops and skill-building exercises, you'll master:

- **Statistical Process Control** - Monitoring and improving manufacturing and service processes
- **Reliability Engineering** - Predicting and improving system performance over time
- **Life Distributions** - Modeling failure patterns using exponential, Weibull, gamma, and log-normal distributions
- **Fault Tree Analysis** - Visualizing and quantifying system failure modes
- **Physical Acceleration Models** - Converting lab test results to field performance estimates
- **Design of Experiments** - Planning and analyzing experiments to optimize processes
- **Quality Control Charts** - Detecting process changes and maintaining quality standards

## Using This Book

The book is organized into thematic parts, each containing numbered workshop chapters. Each chapter includes:

- **Narrative explanations** that introduce concepts in plain language
- **Runnable code examples** that demonstrate techniques step-by-step
- **Learning Checks** with interactive questions and collapsible answers
- **Visual examples** using plots and diagrams to build intuition

You can read the book online at [timothyfraser.com/sigma](https://www.timothyfraser.com/sigma), or follow along with the code using [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud) or your local R/Python environment.
