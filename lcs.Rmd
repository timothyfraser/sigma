## Learning Check 1 {.unnumbered #LC1}

**Question**
  
```{r img_bank, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 0.5, fig.cap=figcap("Bank of Evil, from Despicable Me"), out.width="100%", fig.height = 0.5}

A local business is trying to open a new branch and needs a short-term loan. They meet with a bank, but are surprised by the interest rates, so they do a little research. Over the last 5 years:

- 50 businesses applied to this bank for loans.

- 29 receive loans.

- 18 went bankrupt.

- 13 of those that went bankrupt got loans.

1. Our local business wants to know: what's the probability that a firms goes bankrupt, given that they received a loan? 

2. Assume that a bankruptcy rate above 10% indicates bad lending practices. Should you stay away from that bank?

We know the following:

```{r}
# The probability of getting a loan (13) given that you went bankrupt (18)
p_loan_bankrupt <- 13 / 18
# Probability of going bankrupt (18), whether or not you got a loan (50)
p_bankrupt <- 18 / 50
# Probability of NOT going bankrupt (50 - 18 = 32), whether or not you got a loan (50)
p_no_bankrupt <- 32 / 50
# Probability of getting a loan (29), whether or not you go bankrupt (50)
p_loan <- 29 / 50
# Probability you get a loan (26), given that you don't go bankrupt (32)
p_loan_no_bankrupt <- 26 / 32

# Apply Bayes Rule
p_bankrupt_loan <- p_loan_bankrupt * p_bankrupt /
  (p_loan_bankrupt * p_bankrupt + p_loan_no_bankrupt * p_no_bankrupt)
# Check!
p_bankrupt_loan
```
Looks like there is a 33% chance that you will go bankrupt if you get a loan. That's much higher than 10%. Maybe be a little wary of that bank?

```{r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
firms <- tibble(
  bankrupt = c("no", "no", "no", "yes", "no", "yes", "yes", "yes", "no", "no", "yes",

              "no", "no", "no", "no", "yes", "no") %>% factor(levels = c("yes", "no")),
  loan = c("yes", "yes", "yes", "yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "yes",

            "no", "yes", "yes", "yes", "no", "no") %>% factor(levels=  c("yes", "no")))

firms %>% table()

# What's the likelihood that they would default if they receive a loan?
firms %>% 
  summarize(
    # The goal (posterior)
    p_bankrupt_loan = sum(bankrupt == "yes" & loan == "yes") / sum(loan == "yes"),
    # The data
    p_loan_bankrupt = sum(loan == "yes" & bankrupt == "yes") / sum(bankrupt == "yes"),
    p_loan_no_bankrupt = sum(loan == "yes" & bankrupt == "no") / sum(bankrupt == "no"),
    p_bankrupt = sum(bankrupt == "yes") / sum(loan == "yes" | loan == "no"),
    p_no_bankrupt = sum(bankrupt == "no") / sum(loan == "yes" | loan == "no"),
    # Now recalculate the goal, using the data we have collected.
    # Does 'bayes' equal 'p_bankrupt_loan'?
    bayes = p_loan_bankrupt * p_bankrupt / (p_loan_bankrupt * p_bankrupt + p_loan_no_bankrupt * p_no_bankrupt))
```

```{r, eval =FALSE}
# Clear excess data
remove(firms, p_loan_bankrupt, p_bankrupt, p_no_bankrupt, p_loan, p_loan_no_bankrupt, p_bankrupt_loan)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Clear excess data
remove(orders, p_coffee, p_scone, p_coffee_no_scone, p_coffee_scone, p_scone_coffee)
