name: Sigma Rmd House Style
version: 1

goals:
  - Make AI-written content match the tone and structure used in this repository’s Rmd Gitbook.

style:
  tone:
    - Friendly, encouraging, classroom-oriented
    - Plain language first; minimal jargon and define terms when used
    - Actionable and example-driven; keep explanations short and focused
  formatting:
    - Prefer short paragraphs (1–3 sentences) and bullet lists for steps
    - Bold key ideas sparingly using **markdown bold**
    - Use descriptive Markdown links over bare URLs
    - Insert intentional whitespace with <br> only when needed for visual breaks

rmd_conventions:
  headings:
    - Top-level chapter header: "# Title"
    - Unnumbered section: append attribute "{-}", e.g., "## Getting Started {-}"
    - Learning Check header: "## Learning Check N {.unnumbered .LC}"
  learning_checks:
    - Present a clearly labeled "**Question**" section
    - Follow with a collapsible answer block using HTML details/summary:
      - <details><summary>**[View Answer!]**</summary> ... </details>
    - Provide minimal, runnable R code chunks in answers
  chunks:
    - Default chunk options per chapter setup: cache=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE
    - Prefer explicit function qualification on conflicts (e.g., select = dplyr::select)
    - Favor tidyverse idioms and clear ggplot themes (e.g., theme_classic(base_size = 14))
  images:
    - Include with knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/<file>")
    - Use out.width = "100%" and fig.align = 'center' when appropriate
  math:
    - Inline with \( ... \), display with $$ ... $$

content_preferences:
  - Provide concrete examples before abstract discussion
  - Use small, reproducible datasets and code blocks
  - When listing steps, number them; when alternatives, use bullets
  - Explain why a step is taken when it aids understanding; avoid verbose theory

do_not_do:
  - Do not output bare URLs without context
  - Do not write overly long paragraphs (>5 sentences)
  - Do not add code comments that narrate obvious steps
  - Do not introduce frameworks or packages not already used unless requested

file_conventions:
  - New chapters must be added to `_bookdown.yml` under `rmd_files`
  - Place images in `images/` and reference via relative paths
  - Keep compiled artifacts out of source files; `docs/` is the render target

snippets:
  learning_check:
    - |
      ## Learning Check N {.unnumbered .LC}

      **Question**

      Prompt text here...

      <details><summary>**[View Answer!]**</summary>

      ```{r}
      # minimal, focused code showing the solution
      ```

      </details>
  setup_chunk:
    - |
      ```{r setup, include=FALSE}
      knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
      library(tidyverse)
      ```

review_checklist:
  - Headings use proper attributes (`{-}`, `.LC`) and hierarchy
  - Learning Checks include collapsible answers with runnable code
  - Chunk options are set to quiet and reproducible
  - Images referenced from `images/` with appropriate sizing/alignment
  - Links are descriptive; math uses proper delimiters
