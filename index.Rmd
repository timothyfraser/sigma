# About this Book

This comprehensive textbook provides hands-on training in **System Reliability and Six Sigma techniques using R and Python**. Designed specifically for Cornell University's SYSEN 5300 course, this book bridges the gap between statistical theory concepts and practical coding implementation of these advanced statistical techniques.

## What You'll Learn

Through a series of interactive workshops and skill-building exercises, you'll master:

- **Statistical Process Control** - Monitoring and improving manufacturing and service processes
- **Reliability Engineering** - Predicting and improving system performance over time
- **Life Distributions** - Modeling failure patterns using exponential, Weibull, gamma, and log-normal distributions
- **Fault Tree Analysis** - Visualizing and quantifying system failure modes
- **Physical Acceleration Models** - Converting lab test results to field performance estimates
- **Regression Analysis** - Modeling relationships between variables in complex systems
- **Design of Experiments** - Planning and analyzing controlled experiments
- **Response Surface Methodology** - Optimizing processes through systematic experimentation

## Learning Approach

Each chapter combines:
- **Theoretical foundations** with clear explanations
- **Hands-on coding workshops** in both R and Python
- **Case studies** from manufacturing, healthcare, and service industries
- **Interactive exercises** with immediate feedback
- **Visual learning** through plots, diagrams, and flowcharts

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with R programming
- Understanding of fundamental statistics
- Access to RStudio or Posit Cloud (recommended)
